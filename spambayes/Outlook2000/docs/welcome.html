<h1>Welcome to SpamBayes <br>
</h1>
<p>SpamBayes is an Outlook plugin that provides a spam filter based on
statistical analysis of
your personal mail. &nbsp;Unlike many other spam detection systems,
SpamBayes
actually learns what you consider spam, and continually adapts as both
your regular email and spam patterns change.</p>
<p>When you first start Outlook after SpamBayes has been installed, the
SpamBayes Installation Wizard will appear.&nbsp; This Wizard will guide
you through the configuration process and allow you to quickly have
SpamBayes filtering your mail.&nbsp; This document contains additional
information which will help make SpamBayes effective from the first
time you use it.</p>
<p>Please remember that this is free software; please be patient, and
note that there are plenty of things to improve.&nbsp; There are ways
you can help, even if you aren't a programmer - you could help with
this documentation, or <a
 href="http://www.spambayes.org/donations.html">make a donation</a>, or
any number of other ways - please see the <a
 href="http://www.spambayes.org">main project
page</a> for information.&nbsp; The list of <a
 href="http://www.spambayes.org/faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a>
may also answer some of yours.</p>

the documentation, see <a href="../About.html">About SpamBayes</a>.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
SpamBayes has no builtin
rules, so anything you consider spam will be treated as spam by this
system, even if it does not conform to the traditional definitions of
spam.&nbsp; This means that SpamBayes requires <span
 style="font-style: italic;">training </span>before it will be
effective.&nbsp; There are two ways that this training can be done:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Allow SpamBayes to learn as it goes.&nbsp; Initially, SpamBayes
will consider all mail items <span style="font-style: italic;">unsure</span>,
and each item will be used to
train.&nbsp; In this scenario, SpamBayes will take some time to become
effective.&nbsp; It will rarely make mistakes, but will continue to be
unsure about items until the training information grows.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Pre-sorting mail into two folders; one containing only examples
of good messages, and another containing only examples of spam.&nbsp;
SpamBayes will then process all these messages gathering the clues it
uses to filter mail..&nbsp; Depending on how many messages you train
on, SpamBayes will be immediately effective at correctly classifying
your mail.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Installation Wizard will guide you through these options.</p>
<p>It is important to note that even when SpamBayes has little training
information, it rarely gets things wrong - the worst it generally does
is to classify a message as <span style="font-style: italic;">unsure</span>.&nbsp;
However, as mentioned, the more training information SpamBayes has, the
less it is unsure about new messages.&nbsp; See using the plugin below
for more information.</p>
<h3>Using the Plugin</h3>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0"
 style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">This section describes how the
plugin operates once it is configured.&nbsp;
You can access the SpamBayes features from the SpamBayes toolbar (shown
to the right), but
in general, SpamBayes will simply and silently filter your mail.<br>

<p>As messages arrive, they are given a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">spam score</span>.&nbsp; This score is
the measure of how "spammy" the system has decided a mail is, with 100%
being certain spam, and 0% meaning the message is certainly not
spam.&nbsp; The SpamBayes addin uses these scores to classify mail into
one of three categories -
<span style="font-style: italic;">certain spam</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">unsure</span>, and good messages.&nbsp;
Good messages are often
known in the anti-spam community as <span style="font-style: italic;">ham</span>.</p>
<p>Mail that is classified as good is never touched by this plugin -
they
will remain in your inbox, or be filtered normally by Outlook's builtin
rules.&nbsp; Mail that is classified as either <span
 style="font-style: italic;">unsure</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">certain spam</span>
is moved into different folders for future review.</p>
<p>Outlook does not allow us to automatically add the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">spam score</span> to your Outlook folder
views - but you can <a
 href="file:///e:/src/spambayes/Outlook2000/about.html#Field">do it
manually by following these instructions</a>.<br>
</p>
There are three ways in which the system can get things wrong:
<ul>
  <li>A spam stays in your inbox.&nbsp; This is known as a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">false negative</span>.&nbsp; In this case
you can either drag the message to the Spam folder or click on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Delete as Spam</span> button on the
Outlook
toolbar.&nbsp; In both cases, the message will be trained as spam and
will be moved to the spam folder.</li>
  <li>Any message is moved to the unsure folder.&nbsp; In this case,
the system is simply unsure about the message, and moves it to the
possible spam folder for human review.&nbsp; All unsure messages should
be manually classified; good messages can either be dragged back to the
inbox, or have the <span style="font-style: italic;">Recover from Spam</span>
toolbar button clicked, while spam messages can either be dragged to
the
Spam folder or have the <span style="font-style: italic;">Delete as
Spam</span>
toobar button (shown above) clicked.&nbsp; In all cases, the system
will
automatically
be trained appropriately.</li>
  <li>A wanted (ham) message is moved to the Spam folder. This is known
as a <span style="font-style: italic;">false positive</span>.<span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>&nbsp;In
this case you can either drag the message back to the folder from which
it came (generally the inbox), or click on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Recover from Spam</span> button.&nbsp; In
both cases the message will be trained as good, and moved back to the
original folder.</li>
</ul>
Note that in all cases, as you take corrective action on the mail, the
system is also trained.&nbsp; This makes it less likely that another
similar mail will be incorrectly classified in the future.<br>
