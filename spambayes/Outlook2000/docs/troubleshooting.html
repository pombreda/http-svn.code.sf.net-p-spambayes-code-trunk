<h1>Troubleshooting the SpamBayes Outlook addin</h1>
This is a list of common problems, and hopefully their solutions.&nbsp;
Please feel free to suggest additional topics.&nbsp; Currently, we have
the following problems listed:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Addin_doesnt_load">Addin doesn't load</a></li>
  <li><a href="#NoToolbar">Addin loads, but no toolbar items can be
seen</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Messages_fail_to_filter">Messages fail to filter</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Messages_have_incorrect_or_unexpected">Messages have
incorrect or unexpected Spam values</a></li>
  <li><a href="#All_other_problems">All other problems</a></li>
</ul>
There is also an <a href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/faq.html">online
FAQ for SpamBayes</a> which may have additional information of
use.&nbsp; You may also wish to see the <a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/spambayes/spambayes/Outlook2000/docs/troubleshooting.html?rev=HEAD">latest
online version of this document</a> for problems added since
release.&nbsp; If you must send someone a mail about SpamBayes, <a
 href="#mail">please read this first</a>.<br>

<h2><a name="Addin_doesnt_load"></a>Addin doesn't load</h2>
When you start Outlook, there is no SpamBayes item in the
toolbar, and no filtering occurs.&nbsp; To resolve this:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#CheckLog">Check the log file</a>.&nbsp; If a log file
for this session exists, then see if it contains an error.&nbsp; If
not, then the addin may be operating, but simply not displaying the
toolbar items.&nbsp; <a href="#NoToolbar">Follow this procedure to
restore the toolbar</a>.&nbsp; If there is an error in the log file,
please <a href="#ReportABug">report
a bug</a>.&nbsp; If no log file for this session exists, continue the
following steps.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#InstallationType">Determine your
installation type</a>.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>If you are running a binary version (ie, you downloaded a single
installation program), then perform the following
steps:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Start Outlook, and select <span style="font-style: italic;">Tools</span>-&gt;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Options</span> to display the main Options
dialog.</li>
    <li>Select the tab labelled <span style="font-style: italic;">Other</span>,
then click on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Advanced</span>
button.</li>
    <li>Click on the <span style="font-style: italic;">COM Add-Ins</span>
button.</li>
    <li>If the SpamBayes addin is not listed, then SpamBayes should be
reinstalled (Note that running <span style="font-style: italic;">regsvr32.exe
spambayes_addin.dll</span> from the SpamBayes directory may also solve
this problem)</li>
    <li>If the SpamBayes addin is listed but not checked, then simply
check it and close the dialog.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>If you are running <span style="font-weight: bold;">Outlook 2002</span>,
you may find that if you go back to the dialog, the addin will still be
unselected.&nbsp; In this case, perform the following:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to <span style="font-style: italic;">Help-&gt;About
Microsoft Outlook</span>.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li>Click the Disabled Items button. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Select SpamBayes.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Click Enable.</li>
    <li>Restart Outlook 2002.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>If you are running from source code, please re-register the
addin, as per the README.txt file.</li>
</ul>
If none of that works, I am stumped!
<ol>
  <ol>
  </ol>
</ol>
<h2><a name="NoToolbar"></a>Addin loads, but no toolbar items can be
seen</h2>
If it appears the addin has loaded and is working correctly (ie, <a
 href="#CheckLog">checking the log file</a> indicates normal operation)
but you can not see any toolbar items for the addin, try the
following:.&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that you are displaying the 'SpamBayes' toolbar -
select
View -&gt; Toolbars, and ensure that "SpamBayes" is selected.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Try resetting the toolbars:
    <ol>
      <li>Select <span style="font-style: italic;">View</span>-&gt; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Toolbars</span>-&gt; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Customize</span> to display
the toolbar options dialog</li>
      <li>Select the tab labelled <span style="font-style: italic;">Toolbars</span>,
select the 'Standard' toolbar,
and click <span style="font-style: italic;">Reset</span></li>
      <li>Restart Outlook </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Try deleting the SpamBayes toolbar</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Select <span style="font-style: italic;">View</span>-&gt; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Toolbars</span>-&gt; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Customize</span> to display
the toolbar options dialog</li>
    <li>Select the tab labelled <span style="font-style: italic;">Toolbars</span>,
select the 'SpamBayes' toolbar,
and click <span style="font-style: italic;">Delete</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Restart Outlook<br>
      </span></li>
  </ol>
</ul>
If all else fails, you can completely reset the Outlook toolbars by
removing the file <span style="font-style: italic;">\Documents and
Settings\{username}\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook\outcmd.dat</span>.&nbsp;
Although this is undocumented by Microsoft, we have never heard reports
of problems - but you may like to make a copy of the file just in case.<br>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Messages_fail_to_filter"></a>Messages fail to filter</h2>
This is when messages arrive, but have no <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span> field.&nbsp; Note that this is
different from a message having an incorrect or unexpected Spam value -
that case is covered next.&nbsp; This is for messages that have a
completely blank spam score.&nbsp; To resolve this:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Check that filtering is enabled.&nbsp; Select the SpamBayes
manager, then ensure the button Enable Filtering is checked.&nbsp; If
you are unable to select this button due to insufficient training
information, please review the <a
 href="../about.html##Installing_and_Configuring">initial configuration
documentation for information on training</a>.</li>
  <li>If only the occasional message fails to filter, then it is likely
that the message is in a format we don't understand.&nbsp; There is
almost certainly an error listed in the log file.&nbsp; Please <a
 href="#ReportABug">report a bug</a>, attaching both the <a
 href="#CheckLog">log file</a> and the message that caused the error.</li>
  <li>If all messages fail to filter, we have a more serious problem,
but again, please <a href="#ReportABug">report
a bug</a>, attaching the <a href="#CheckLog">log
file.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Messages_have_incorrect_or_unexpected"></a>Messages have
incorrect or unexpected Spam values</h2>
This is when filtering appears to work OK, except that the spam values
are wrong.&nbsp; To resolve this<br>
<ul>
  <li>If the messages are all scoring as "unsure", with a score of 0.5,
then you may have lost your training database.&nbsp; From the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">SpamBayes manager </span>dropdown, check
how many spam and ham have been loaded by the system.&nbsp; If this
number is very low (like zero!) then you probably need to perform a
full
re-train of your database.</li>
  <li>If the messages have apparently random, but unexpected scores,
then there are two possibilities; either SpamBayes is simply behaving
what appears to be strangely, but really is correctly, or that some of
the spam payload is invisible to SpamBayes.&nbsp; In both cases,
perform
the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the message is selected in the Outlook preview pane, and
from the <span style="font-style: italic;">SpamBayes manager</span>
dropdown, select <span style="font-style: italic;">Show Spam clues for
current message</span>.&nbsp; This should open a new mail message with
the clues.</li>
    <li>Part of the clues shows the body of the spam message.&nbsp; If
this message correctly shows the spam text, then it is likely SpamBayes
is behaving correctly.&nbsp; In this case, you may wish to mail the
clues to the SpamBayes mailing list for help in decoding the clues, but
it is likely that SpamBayes is behaving correctly given your current
training data.<br>
    </li>
    <li>If it appears that part of the spam payload is missing, then
you have probably stumbled across a bug - please mail the clues to the
mailing list.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Process Descriptions<br>
</h2>
This explains some of the processes above in more detail.<br>
<h3><a name="InstallationType"></a>Determine your installation type.</h3>
If you are running from Python source code, and installed Python, plus
SpamBayes as seperate components, then you are running the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">source code version</span>.&nbsp; If you
downloaded an installer .EXE file, then you are running the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">binary version</span>.<br>
<h3><a name="CheckLog"></a>Check the log file</h3>
<a href="#InstallationType">Determine your installation type</a>.&nbsp;
If you are running the source code version, then please see README.txt
in the Outlook2000 directory.<br>
If you are running the binary version, then the SpamBayes addin writes
a log in your Windows temp directory.&nbsp; This directory is generally
<span style="font-style: italic;">\WINDOWS\TEMP</span> for Windows 9x,
or <span style="font-style: italic;">\Documents and
Settings\{username}\Local
Settings\Temp</span> for Windows 2000/XP.<br>
<br>
Note that by default, in Windows 2000 and XP, Windows Explorer will not
show the <span style="font-style: italic;">Local Settings</span>
directory, as it is hidden.&nbsp; You can convince Windows Explorer to
show this directory (and therefore allow you to see the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Temp</span> directory under it by doing
either:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Select the folder <span style="font-style: italic;">\Documents
and Settings\{username}</span>.&nbsp; This directory should be
reflected in the Address Bar.&nbsp; In the Address Bar, simply type at
the end "\Local Settings" (thereby giving that full path name), and
press <span style="font-style: italic;">Enter</span>.&nbsp; Explorer
will then show this folder.</li>
</ul>
or
<ul>
  <li>Select <span style="font-style: italic;">Tools-&gt;Folder Options</span>,
select the <span style="font-style: italic;">View</span> tab, and in
the list, select <span style="font-style: italic;">Show hidden files
and folders</span>.&nbsp; Select OK.&nbsp; This folder will now be
visible.&nbsp; You may like to then reset this option back to the
default value.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The log file for the
most recent execution of Outlook is named <span
 style="font-style: italic;">spambayes1.log</span>, the second most
recent is named <span style="font-style: italic;">spambayes2.log</span>,
and so on for the four previous runs.&nbsp; You can view this file with
notepad.&nbsp; Usually, you will simply see
messages which indicate that SpamBayes is doing its job; however
in some cases there will be errors in this file.&nbsp; If there are
errors, please <a href="#ReportABug">report a bug</a>.<br>
<h4>If the log file is very large</h4>
This probably means that SpamBayes failed to process a large number of
(or a few, large) emails.&nbsp; In that case, please perform the
following steps:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure all messages in your watch folders are marked as read</li>
  <li>Restart Outlook (use <span style="font-style: italic;">Exit and
Sign off</span> if it is in your <span style="font-style: italic;">File</span>
menu)</li>
  <li>Send youself a test message, and wait for it to arrive.</li>
  <li>Exit Outlook.</li>
</ul>
You should have a new log file containing the error when classifying
the test message.&nbsp; If no error occurs processing the test message,
the previous large log file will still exist (see above).&nbsp; Either
edit the file using a text editor to extract just the error
information, or zip it up.&nbsp; If you don't know what that means,
please send a mail.<br>
