<h1>SpamBayes Outlook Plugin</h1>
<br>
This plugin provides a spam filter based on statistical analysis of
your personal mail. &nbsp;Unlike other spam detection systems, SpamBayes
actually learns what you consider spam, and continually adapts as both
your regular email and spam patterns change.&nbsp; There are no builtin
rules, so anything you consider spam will be treated as spam by this
system, even if it does not conform to the traditional definitions of
spam.<br>
<br>
Some time must be spent configuring the system, and performing initial
training.&nbsp; Once this has been completed, you will find the filter
amazingly effective and making very few errors.<br>
<br>
Bear in mind that this is an early version, and there are plenty of
things to improve, particularly related to the initial configuration and
training process.&nbsp; Please bear with us.&nbsp; This is free
software, so your help is needed - please see the <a
 href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net">main project page</a> for
information.<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="Using_the_plugin"></a>Using the plugin<br>
</h2>
As messages arrive, they are given a "spam score".&nbsp; This score is
the measure of how "spammy" the system has decided a mail is, with 100%
being certain spam, and 0% meaning the message is certainly not
spam.&nbsp; The SpamBayes addin uses three different spam categories
based on these scores to classify mail into one of three categories -
certain spam, unsure, and good messages.&nbsp; Good messages are often
known in the anti-spam community as <span style="font-style: italic;">ham</span>.<br>
Mail that is classified as good is never touched by this plugin - they
will remain in your inbox, or be filtered normally by Outlook's builtin
rules.&nbsp; Mail that is classified as either unsure, or certain spam
is moved into different folders for future review.<br>
There are three ways in which the system can get things wrong:
<ul>
  <li>A spam stays in your inbox.&nbsp; This is known as a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">false negative</span>.&nbsp; In this case
you can either drag the message to the Spam folder or click on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Delete as Spam</span> button on the Outlook
toolbar.&nbsp; In both cases, the message will be trained as spam and
will be moved to the spam folder.</li>
  <li>Any message is moved to the unsure folder.&nbsp; In this case,
the system is simply unsure about the message, and moves it to the
possible spam folder for human review.&nbsp; All unsure messages should
be manually classified; good messages can either be dragged back to the
inbox, or have the <span style="font-style: italic;">Recover from Spam</span>
toolbar button clicked, while spam messages can either be dragged to the
Spam folder or have the <span style="font-style: italic;">Delete as Spam</span>
toobar button clicked.&nbsp; In all cases, the system will automatically
be trained appropriately.</li>
  <li>A wanted (ham) message is moved to the Spam folder. This is known
as a <span style="font-style: italic;">false positive</span>.<span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>&nbsp;In
this case you can either drag the message back to the folder from which
it came (generally the inbox), or click on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Recover from Spam</span> button.&nbsp; In
both cases the message will be trained as good, and moved back to the
original folder.</li>
</ul>
Note that in all cases, as you take corrective action on the mail, the
system is also trained.&nbsp; This makes it less likely that another
similar mail will be incorrectly classified in the future.<br>

<h2><a name="Installing_and_Configuring"></a>Installing and Configuring
the plugin</h2>
If you download the installer version of this plugin (ie, you
downloaded a .EXE file you use to install), then everthing is installed
and just needs to be configured.&nbsp; If you downloaded the sourcecode
version of the plugin, please view README.txt for installation
instructions.<br>
Configuring the plugin requires the following steps:<br>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0"
 style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <ol>
        <li>Confirm the plugin is installed:<br>
Start Outlook, and look at the standard Outlook toolbar.&nbsp; On the
right-hand side, you should see an Anti-Spam dropdown button.&nbsp; If
this button appears, then the plugin is correctly installed and ready to
use.&nbsp; If the button does not appear, please see XXXXXXXXXX</li>
        <li>Create <span style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Usure</span> folders<br>
Use the normal Outlook functions to create two new folders.&nbsp; These
can be named anything you like, and can appear anywhere in the folder
hierarchy you choose - however, it is recommended you call them
something like <span style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Possible Spam</span>.</li>
        <li>Manually create initial training data<br>
Go through your <span style="font-style: italic;">Inbox, Deleted Items</span>
and any other folders likely to have spam, and move as much as possible
to the new Spam folder you just created.&nbsp; Try and get as much Spam
out of your inbox as possible, as your inbox will form the initial set
of good messages we train on.&nbsp; Don't worry too much about missing
one or two spam - the system is likely to find them for you as we
rescore your existing email.</li>
        <li>Configure and Train SpamBayes<br>
Now we have our folders setup with some initial training data, we can
configure the plugin.&nbsp; From the <span style="font-style: italic;">Anti-Spam</span>
button on the toolbar select <span style="font-style: italic;">Anti-Spam
Manager...</span>&nbsp; This will display the main dialog, as shown to
the right.</li>
        <li>Select Train Now, and the training dialog, also shown to
the right will appear.&nbsp; The Inbox will be the default for good
messages, so you need to select your new Spam folder as the source of
junk messages.&nbsp; Ensure that <span style="font-style: italic;">Score
messages after training</span> is selected, so we can see how effective
our Inbox cleanup was.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Click on the Train Now button, and a progress indicator
will be displayed as your messages are trained, and another progress
indicator as they are scored.&nbsp; Close the training window to return
to the Anti-Spam window.</li>
      </ol>

<h2><a name="Field"></a>Viewing and Using the Spam Score Field</h2>
A custom property named <span style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span>
is added to all Outlook messages scored.&nbsp; You can teach Outlook to
display this field as a column in any table view, like the standard
Messages view.
<p> This takes some work, and has to be done again for every folder in
which you want to display a Spam column - typically this will be all
folders you are filtering, and your Spam and Unsure folders.&nbsp;
Perform the following steps<br>
</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0"
 style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <ul>
        <li>While looking at an Outlook table view (like Messages),
right-click on the line with column headers (From, Subject, To,
Received, ...).         In the context menu that pops up, click on Field
Chooser. A box         with title <i>Field Chooser</i> pops up.</li>
        <li>In the drop-down list at the top of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Field Chooser</span> window, select <span
 style="font-style: italic;">User Defined Fields</span></li>
        <li>Below the drop-down, you         should see a rectangular
button with a <span style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span> label . This<span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span> should be automatically created for
all folders managed by the system, but if it does not appear, you will
need to add it yourself. &nbsp;To do this, perform the following steps</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In the lower left corner of the <i>Field Chooser</i> box,
click <i>New...</i>.  A box with title <i>New Field</i> pops up. </li>
          <li>In the <i>Name:</i> box, type Spam. </li>
          <li>In the <i>Type:</i> dropdown list, select <i>Percent</i>.
This is the         third choice in the dropdown list.         Do not
select any other format -- it won't work. </li>
          <li>The <i>Format:</i> select the first entry in the list -
"Rounded".&nbsp; The Field Chooser should now look like the first image
on the right.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Click OK in the <i>New Field</i> box.  Now you're back in
the <i>Field Chooser</i> box, with a new <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span> button shown, as the second
figure shows.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Use your mouse to drag the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span> button to the column header
position where you want to see the Spam column.  You don't have to be
precise         here -- you can rearrange or resize the column later
just by dragging         it around. </li>
        <li>You're done!  Close the <i>Field Chooser</i> box.</li>
      </ul>

</ul>
Outlook's standard Automatic Formatting features can also be taught how
to access the value of this field; for example, you could tell Outlook
to display rows with suspected spam messages in green italic.  However,
for whatever reason, the Outlook Rules Wizard does not allow creating
rules based on user-defined fields.  That's why this addin supplies its
own filtering rules.<br>
<h2><a name="Filtering"></a>Configuring the plugin for filtering</h2>
Once the system is trained an configured, you are ready to enable the
filtering capabilities.&nbsp; From the Anti-Spam manager, select <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Filters</span>.&nbsp; From this dialog you
can select all the folders that you wish to watch for spam.&nbsp; You
also configure the folder where you want the certain spam and unsure
messages to be moved to.<br>
Once this is done, you simply enable filtering from the main dialog,
and sit back and wait for spam!&nbsp; See <a href="#Using_the_plugin">using
the plugin</a> for details further details.<br>
