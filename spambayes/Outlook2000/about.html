<h1>SpamBayes Outlook Plugin<br>
</h1>
<span style="font-style: italic;">NOTE: This is very very early code.
&nbsp;If you are looking at this, you have probably been told about it
against our better judgement &lt;wink&gt;. &nbsp;Stuff doesnt work
correctly. &nbsp;If you want something known to work well today for alot
of people, this is not for you.</span> &nbsp;That said, this plug-in
works amazingly well! So welcome aboard.<span
 style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
This spam filter uses Bayesian analysis to filter spam. &nbsp;Unlike
other spam detection systems, Bayesian systems actually "learn" about
what you consider spam, and continually adapt as both your regular email
and spam patterns change. The source code is maintained at <a
 href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.<br>
<br>
Here you can find information on:<br>

<h2><a name="Training"></a>Training</h2>
Due to the nature of the system, it must be trained before it can be
effective. &nbsp;Although the system does learn over time, when first
installed it has no knowledge of either spam or good email.<br>
<h3>Initial Training</h3>
When first installed, it is recommended you perform the following steps:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Create two folders - one for "Spam", and one for "Possible Spam"</li>
  <li>Go through your Inbox and Deleted Items, and move as much spam as
you can find to the "Spam" folder. &nbsp;Try and get as much Spam out of
your inbox as possible.</li>
  <li>Select the <span style="font-style: italic;">Training</span>
dialog. &nbsp;Nominate your Spam folder for spam, and your Inbox for
good messages, and start training.</li>
</ul>
To see how effective your Inbox cleanup was, you may like to try:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Filter Now</span>
dialog.</li>
  <li>Select your Inbox as the folder to filter.</li>
  <li>Select <span style="font-style: italic;">Score messages, but
dont perform filter action</span>.</li>
  <li>Clear both checkboxes so all messages will be scored.</li>
  <li>Start the score operation.</li>
</ul>
You can then look at and sort by the Spam field in your Inbox - this is
likely to find hidden spam that you missed from your inbox cleanup.
<h3>Incremental Training</h3>
When you drag a message to your Spam folder, it will be automatically
trained as spam. &nbsp;Thus, as the classifier misses spam (or is unsure
about them), it learns as you correct it.<br>
If messages are dropped back into a folder being watched, they are trained as good -
thus, the system learns what good messages look like should it
incorrectly classify it as spam or possible spam.<br>
You will also notice a "Delete as Spam" button (in all folders except
the Spam folder) and a "Recover from Spam" button in the Spam and Unsure
folders. &nbsp;These buttons have the same effect as the drags above.
&nbsp;(Note that currently the "Recover from Spam" option will also restore the message to
the folder from which it was originally filtered.<br>
<h2><a name="Field"></a>Viewing the Spam Score Field</h2>
A custom property named <span style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span>
is added to all Outlook messages scored. This is a percentage indicating
the likelihood of the message being spam (ie, 0% is "certain" ham; 100%
if "certain" spam). You can teach Outlook to display this field as a
column in any table view, like the standard Messages view.
<p> This takes some work, and has to be done again for every folder in
which you want to display a Spam column: </p>
<ul>
  <li>While looking at an Outlook table view (like Messages),
right-click on the line with column headers (From, Subject, To,
Received, ...).         In the context menu that pops up, click on Field
Chooser.  A box         with title <i>Field Chooser</i> pops up.</li>
  <li>In the drop-down list at the top of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Field Chooser</span> window, select <span
 style="font-style: italic;">User Defined Fields</span></li>
  <li>Below the drop-down, you         should see a rectangular button
with a <span style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span> label . This<span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span> should be automatically created for
all folders managed by the system, but if it does not appear, you will
need to add it yourself. &nbsp;To do this, perform the following steps</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In the lower left corner of the <i>Field Chooser</i> box, click
 <i>New...</i>.  A box with title <i>New Field</i> pops up. </li>
    <li>In the <i>Name:</i> box, type Spam. </li>
    <li>In the <i>Type:</i> dropdown list, select <i>Percent</i>.
This is the         third choice in the dropdown list.         Do not
select any other format -- it won't work. </li>
    <li>The <i>Format:</i> select the first entry in the list -
"Rounded"</li>
    <li>Click OK in the <i>New Field</i> box.  Now you're back in the <i>Field
Chooser</i> box, with a new <span style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span>
button shown. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Use your mouse to drag the <span style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span>
button to the column header position         where you want to see the
Spam column.  You don't have to be precise         here -- you can
rearrange or resize the column later just by dragging         it around. </li>
  <li>You're done!  Close the <i>Field Chooser</i> box. </li>
</ul>
Outlook's standard Automatic Formatting features can also be taught how
to access the value of this field; for example, you could tell Outlook
to display rows with suspected spam messages in green italic.  However,
for whatever reason, the Outlook Rules Wizard does not allow creating
rules based on user-defined fields.  That's why this addin supplies its
own filtering rules.
