<span style="font-style: italic;">NOTE: This is very very early code. &nbsp;If
you are looking this, you have probably been told about it against our better
judgement &lt;wink&gt;. &nbsp;Stuff doesnt work correctly. &nbsp;Fields are
funny. &nbsp;If you want something known to work well today for alot of people,
this is not for you.<br>

This spam filter uses Bayesian analysis to filter spam. &nbsp;Unlike other
spam detection systems, Bayesian systems actually "learn" about what you
consider spam, and continually adapt as both your regular email and spam
patterns change.<br>
<h2>Training</h2>
Due to the nature of the system, it must be trained before it can be effective.
&nbsp;Although the system does learn over time, when first installed it has
no knowledge of either spam or good email.<br>
<h3>Initial Training</h3>
When first installed, it is recommended you perform the following steps:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Create two folders - one for "Spam", and one for "Possible Spam"</li>
  <li>Go through your Inbox and Deleted Items, and move as much spam as you
can find to the "Spam" folder. &nbsp;Try and get as much Spam out of your
inbox as possible.</li>
  <li>Select the <span style="font-style: italic;">Training</span> dialog.
&nbsp;Nominate your Spam folder for spam, and your Inbox for good messages,
and start training.</li>
</ul>
To see how effective your Inbox cleanup was, you may like to try:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Filter Now</span> dialog.</li>
  <li>Select your Inbox as the folder to filter.</li>
  <li>Select <span style="font-style: italic;">Score messages, but dont perform
filter action</span>.</li>
  <li>Clear both checkboxes so all messages will be scored.</li>
  <li>Start the score operation.</li>
</ul>
You can then look at and sort by the Spam field in your Inbox - this is likely
to find hidden spam that you missed from your inbox cleanup.
<h3>Incremental Training</h3>
When you drag a message to your Spam folder, it will be automatically trained
as spam. &nbsp;Thus, as the classifier misses spam (or is unsure about them),
it learns as you correct it.<br>
If messages are dropped back into the Inbox, they are trained as good - thus,
the system learns what good messages look like should it incorrectly classify
it as spam or possible spam.<br>
