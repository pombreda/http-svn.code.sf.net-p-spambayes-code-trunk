## Mutt keybindings for spambayes
## Author: Neale Pickett <neale@woozle.org>
##
## This muttrc assumes you are already filtering with a procmail recipie
## similar to:
##
##   :0fw
##   | hammiefilter.py -t
##
##
## This binds 'S' to refile as spam and move to a 'caughtspam' folder.
## 'H' will refile as ham and move to your inbox.  You will want to use
## these on every misclassified message.
##
## As a special bonus, all tagged spam will be colored red on black.
##
## If you have any problems with this, and especially if you have any
## improvements, please mail them to me!  Thanks to Adam Hupp for
## helping out with the muttisms.
