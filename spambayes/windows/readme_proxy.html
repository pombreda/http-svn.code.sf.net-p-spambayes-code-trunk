<h1>SpamBayes Server/Proxy Application</h1>
<h2>Welcome to SpamBayes</h2>

<p><em>Note that if you use Microsoft Outlook, you should probably be using the
Outlook Addin, which was presented as an option at installation time.</em>
If you are using Outlook Express or almost any other mail program, 
you are in the right place</p>

<p>This SpamBayes application sits between your mail server (generally at
your Internet Service Provider) and your mail program. Your mail program still believes
it is talking to a real mail server, but instead it is talking to
SpamBayes, which acts as a <span style="font-style: italic;">proxy</span>
between the two.</p>

<p>All your mail arrives as normal in your mail program, but, as it arrives,
SpamBayes adds a classification to the messages - either <b>ham</b> (good
mail), <b>spam</b> (bad mail), or <b>unsure</b> (messages that SpamBayes isn't
certain about).  You can set your mail program up to automatically
filter messages into folders based on this classification - for example you
might move all <b>spam</b> messages to a folder called "Junk Mail", and all
<b>unsure</b> messages to a folder called "Mail to review".</p>

<p>In order to classify messages, you have to <i>train</i> SpamBayes.  The
easiest method of doing this is via an interface that SpamBayes presents
to you via your web browser.  SpamBayes will list all the messages that have
been received, and let you train them as <b>ham</b> or <b>spam</b>.  You
can also configure SpamBayes via this interface in your web browser.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/faq.html#using-spambayes">
using SpamBayes section in the online FAQ</a> has alot of information
which you may find useful, especially considering how little documentation
is supplied.  The <a href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/">main SpamBayes
project pages</a> may also be of interest.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>You should start the <span style="font-style: italic;">SpamBayes Tray
Icon</span> program, which was installed into your Start menu. This is the
recommended method of operating SpamBayes.  If you right-click on this
icon you will be presented with a number of options to control SpamBayes,
including an option to configure SpamBayes for your system.</p>

<h3>Using the Service</h3>
<p>There is a windows service program installed, but it is not configured
by the installation program. If you configure this manually, you
can continue to use the Tray Icon program, as it will control the
service instead of running the server internally as it normally does.</p>
<p>To install the service, perform the following steps:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Open a command prompt, and change to the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">\Program Files\SpamBayes\proxy</span>
directory.</li>
  <li>Execute <span style="font-style: italic;">pop3proxy_service.exe
-install</span></li>
  <li>Select <span style="font-style: italic;">Control
Panel-&gt;Administrative Tools-&gt;Services</span>, and locate <span
 style="font-style: italic;">SpamBayes Service</span> in the list.</li>
  <li>Change the properties of the service so it logs on with your user
account, rather than the builtin system account. This will ensure
that SpamBayes uses the same configuration and data files when running
as a service and when running as a normal program.</li>
  <li>If desired, change the properties of the service to start at boot
time.</li>
  <li>Start the service</li>
  <li>Start the <span style="font-style: italic;">SpamBayes Tray Icon</span>
program, and confirm the server is running. Configure and manage
spambayes normally.</li>
</ul>
