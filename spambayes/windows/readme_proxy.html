<h1>SpamBayes Server/Proxy Application.</h1>
<br>
Wel come to SpamBayes<br>
<br>
This SpamBayes application sits between your Mail Server (generally at
your ISP) and your Mail program.&nbsp; Your mail program still believes
it is talking to a real mail server, but instead it is talking to
SpamBayes, which acts as a <span style="font-style: italic;">proxy</span>
between the two.<br>
<br>
SpamBayes will let all good email through normally.&nbsp; All Spam or
Unsure items are held by the application for your review.&nbsp; You
review all messages and configure SpamBayes itself via your web browser.<br>
<br>
If you use Microsoft Outlook, you should probably be using the Outlook
Addin, which was presented as an option at installation time.<br>
<br>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
You should start the <span style="font-style: italic;">SpamBayes Tray
Icon</span> program, which was installed on your Start menu.&nbsp; It
is recommended<br>
<br>
<h3>Using the Service</h3>
There is a windows service program installed, but it is not configured
by the installation program.&nbsp; If you configure this manually, you
can continue to use the Tray Icon program, as it will control the
service instead of running the server internally as it normally does.<br>
To install the service, perform the following steps:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Open a command prompt, and change to the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">\Program Files\SpamBayes\proxy</span>
directory.</li>
  <li>Execute <span style="font-style: italic;">pop3proxy_service.exe
-install</span></li>
  <li>Select <span style="font-style: italic;">Control
Panel-&gt;Administrative Tools-&gt;Services</span>, and locate <span
 style="font-style: italic;">SpamBayes Service</span> in the list.</li>
  <li>Change the properties of the service so it logs on with your user
account, rather than the builtin system account.&nbsp; This will ensure
that SpamBayes uses the same configuration and data files when running
as a service and when running as a normal program.</li>
  <li>If desired, change the properties of the service to start at boot
time.</li>
  <li>Start the service</li>
  <li>Start the<span style="font-style: italic;"> SpamBayes Tray Icon</span>
program, and confirm the server is running.&nbsp; Configure and manage
spambayes normally.</li>
</ul>
