This file covers the major changes between each release.  For more details,
the reader is referred to the changelog (changelog.txt in the main directory
of the archive), or for extreme details, to the check-ins archive (please see
<http://mail.python.org/pipermail/spambayes-checkins>)
                                                                   
Changes are broken into sections for each application, plus one that will
probably only interest developers, and one for everything else.

Any actions necessary to move to this release from the previous release are
noted in the "Transition" section.

New in Alpha Release 7
======================

--------------------------
** Incompatible changes **
--------------------------

 o If you are using a pickle for storage, your 'message info' database
   would previously still have been a dbm (where available).  This is
   no longer the case - if you are using a pickle for the statistics
   database, you have a pickle for everything.  Your old 'message info'
   database is not converted (and there is no utility provided to do so).
   If you are using a pickle for storage, you should delete your old
   'spambayes.messageinfo.db' file before restarting after the upgrade.
   You should not suffer any ill effects from this, *unless* you are
   using sb_imapfilter.py.  In that case, you will find that the filter
   trains and classifies all messages in the folders it examines, even
   if it has seen them before - this will only occur once, however.

There should be no other incompatible changes (from 1.0a6) in this release.

 o The scripts have all moved (in the archive), and their names have been
   changed.  If you run "setup.py install", it will offer to remove the old
   ones for you, which we recommend.  In the archive, the scripts are all
   in a 'scripts' directory, and all the scripts start with the "sb_"
   prefix, to avoid clashing with similarly named scripts from other
   packages.  Some name changes go further - "pop3proxy" is now named
   "sb_server", "hammiefilter" is now named "sb_filter", "hammiecli" is now
   named "sb_client", "hammiesrv" is now named "sb_xmlrpcserver", "proxytee"
   is now named "sb_upload", and the experimental "overkill" script is now
   named "sb_pop3dnd".

If you were previously using the "hammie.py" script, you will notice that
it is no longer available.  We recommend that you use either "sb_filter"
(probably with "sb_mboxtrain"), or use "sb_server" and "sb_upload".  If you
wish to continue as you were, you can use the "hammie.py" module, which
will be installed in the "spambayes" package directory, in the same way you
used the old "hammie.py" script.

 o All the backwards compatibility code for options which changed names has
   been removed, which means that you *must* use the correct (new) names.
   A script (sb_chkopts) is provided which, if you run it, will inform you
   if you have any invalid names (if will not output anything if there are
   no problems).

In addition, the values taken by some options have changed, so if you're
upgrading from a previous version, you may need to update your configuration
file (.spambayesrc or bayescustomize.ini)

 o The options to put the classification in the subject or recipient list
   (notate_to and notate_subject) have moved from the "pop3proxy" section
   to the "Headers" section.
 o All the "pop3proxy" storage options (where the cache is stored, the
   number of days before messages expire, and so on) have moved to the
   "Storage" section.
 o The "hammie" debug header options have been removed, and you should use
   the "Headers" evidence header options instead.

Note that pop3proxy (sb_server) and imapfilter users can simply use the web
interface to check their options and correct any that are wrong.  All
incorrectly named options in the configuration file will be removed.

Outlook Plugin
--------------
 o Change the default for the ham/spam imbalance adjustment option to
   False - this should make misclassifications for those with large
   imbalances easier to understand.  Note that we recommend roughly equal
   numbers of ham and spam are trained.
 o Add a warning for those with highly imbalanced ham and spam.
 o Improved the 'Show Clues' results page.
 o When we fail to add the 'Spam' field to a read-only store (eg, hotmail),
   complain less loudly.

POP3 Proxy / SMTP Proxy
-----------------------
 o An error where a failure message would be printed by
   the SMTP proxy, even on success, was fixed.

Web Interface
-------------
 o The bug which caused the "TypeError" when trying to access
   the database after setting a configuration option via the
   interface has been fixed.

POP3 Proxy Service / POP3 Proxy Tray Application
------------------------------------------------

 o Both the pop3proxy_service.py and pop3proxy_tray.py
   scripts are now installed (with "setup.py install") if
   the user is using Windows.

IMAP Filter
-----------
 o Correctly handle IMAP servers that (wrongly) fail to put folder names
   in quotation marks
 o Count all messages being classified instead of just the ones from the
   last folder.
 o Handle a folder name as a literal when presenting a list to choose from.
 o Handle IMAP servers that do not pass a blank result line for an empty
   search.
 o Fix IMAP over SSL.

General
-------
 o Various improvements have been made to the management of the
   'message info' database.  As outlined above, it will now be
   stored as a pickle, if your statistics database uses a pickle.
   In addition, we attempt to close the database when we should,
   and make sure that we explicitly update it.  This should hopefully
   go some way to solving the "DB_RUN_RECOVERY" errors that have
   been regularly reported - we would be interested to hear from
   you if upgrading to 1.0a7 does appear to solve this problem
   for you (email spambayes@python.org).
 o We now try to determine the type of dbm storage used from the
   file, if one already exists.  This should make the transition
   between formats a little easier.
 o Fix sb_xmlrpcserver to work with the renamed (since 1.0a5)
   scripts.
 o Fix the sense of include_trained in sb_mboxtrain.
