This file covers the major changes between each release.  For more details,
the reader is referred to the changelog, or for extreme details, to the
check-ins archive.

Changes are broken into sections for each application, plus one that will
probably only interest developers, and one for everything else.

Any actions necessary to move to this release from the previous release are
noted in the "Transition" section.

New in Alpha Release 3
======================

Outlook Plugin
--------------
 o The Outlook Plugin now works with bsddb[3] databases, and uses them
   rather than pickles, if available.
 o The Outlook Plugin now stores files in the "correct" windows directory.
   These will be automatically migrated.
 o Show all tokens in message when showing clues in Outlook plugin.
 o Fix a bug in the Outlook plugin test code.
 o Only create "Spam" field on mail items in Outlook plugin.
 o MAPI exceptions are better handled.
 o Errors when hotmail connector cannot save the message are suppressed.
 o Tokens are listed one per line in Show Clues.
 o Messages can be scored after training.
 o Plugin *may* now work correctly in non-English locales.
 o Databases are saved after any training operation.
 o Handle malformed messages better in the Outlook plugin.
 o In Outlook plugin, create our own toolbar, rather than using the standard one.
 o Use 'wait' cursor when incremental training in Outlook plugin.
 o In Outlook plugin, save config when dialog closes and not at shutdown.
 o Clean up toolbar images.
 o In Outlook plugin, no longer default to the "Inbox".
 o In Outlook plugin, when filtering, saving the spam score is no longer fatal.

POP3 Proxy
----------
 o The POP3 Proxy can now include the classification in the "To" or
   "Subject" headers, which allows Outlook Express users to perform
   filtering on the classification.
 o The POP3 Proxy can add an id (as a header or in the body) to track
   emails.  This can be used with the SMTP Proxy, or to find a particular
   message from the web interface.
 o Added include_score option to (optionally) note the score of the message
   in a header.
 o Added level (thermostat) and evidence headers for pop3proxy.
 o Added pop3proxy_server to allow pop3proxy to run as a Windows service.
 o Improved configuration page for the user interface.
 o A "Show Clues" button next to each message in the "Review" page of the
   web interface.
 o Messages in the "unknown" cache are expired, just like those in the
   "ham" and "spam" caches.
 o Messages are expired (if old enough) each time a client connects to the
   proxy, rather than on the proxy startup.
 o pop3proxy_port, pop3proxy_server_name and pop3proxy_server_port options
   were removed (these were deprecated in Alpha 2).
 o If a file is removed from the cache (not by the proxy) this no longer
   causes an exception.
 o Messages received in quick succession (within the same second) may not
   have been visible in the "review" page; fixed this.
 o Added "Refresh" button to "Review" page.
 o Improved proxying of "STAT" POP3 command so that a guess at the message
   size is returned.
 o Web interface encourage browsers not to cache the pages.
 o Added an option to display who a message is to in the "Review" page.
 o A new option to correct for a much higher ratio of spam to ham (or
   vice-versa) is available via the interface page.

Developer
---------
 o Added base message classes for use by all Spambayes applications -
   currently used by the IMAP filter and POP3 proxy.
 o Major rework of the configuration file loading and format of Options.py.
 o Test code moved out of pop3proxy.py.
 o Web interface code abstracted out of pop3proxy.py.

General
-------
 o A utility to dump the contents of a CDB database.
 o -c and -d options to mailsort.py
 o A basic filter for Lotus Notes.
 o A SMTP Proxy to allow training via forwarding/bouncing messages.
 o Various files to test "incremental training" (or "self training").
 o Option to mkgraph to spit out counts *or* error rates, and n-day
   averages *or* cumulative.
 o Note when the subject charset is invalid (rather than raising an
   exception).
 o A filter for IMAP.
 o A script to test the effectiveness of following URLs in messages when
   insufficient clues are otherwise present.
 o 'Nonsense' HTML tags are stripped rather than replaced with a space
   (e.g. Wr<!$FS|i|R3$s80sA >inkle Reduc<!$FS|i|R3$s80sA >tion becomes
    "Wrinkle" and "Reduction" rather than "Wr", "inkle", "Reduc" and
    "tion").
 o Decode numeric character entities so that
   yo&#117;r se<!XE>p&#116;ic sys&#116;em becomes "your septic system".
 o <p> and <br> tags are replaced with single blanks.
 o DB classifier keeps a list of "changed words" to prevent saves from updating *all* words.
 o DB classifier no longer caches hapaxes.
 o In muttrc, fix incorrect Spambayes header name.


Transition
==========
 o If you are using the Outlook Plugin and a recent bsddb or bsddb3 is
   available, you will need to do a full retrain.
 o If you had set the environment variable BAYESCUSTOMIZE to point to more
   than one configuration file, you will need to change the separator
   character from a space to the path separator for your platform (a
   semi-colon on windows, a colon on *nix and a newline on Mac OS9)
 o If your old configuration file used the pop3proxy_port,
   pop3proxy_server_name or pop3proxy_server_port options, these will no
   longer work.  Copy the values in them and use the web interface to
   update your configuration file.
 o Your old configuration file more than likely includes deprecated
   settings.  The old settings will still work for the moment, but you
   should take the time to update them.  The "convert_config_file.py"
   script will convert the file for you, without loss of comments, and
   avoiding whitespace changes where possible.
 o If you are using POP3 proxy, you should use the web interface to set the
   location of the "message info" database (a full pathname is
   recommended).
 o If you are using POP3 proxy, it is recommended (but not required) that
   you do a full retrain to take advantage of the "message info" database.
