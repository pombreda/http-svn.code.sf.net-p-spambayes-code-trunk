This file covers the major changes between each release.  For more details,
the reader is referred to the changelog (changelog.txt in the main directory
of the archive), or for extreme details, to the check-ins archive (please see
<http://mail.python.org/pipermail/spambayes-checkins>)
                                                                   
Changes are broken into sections for each application, plus one that will
probably only interest developers, and one for everything else.

Any actions necessary to move to this release from the previous release are
noted in the "Transition" section.

New in Alpha Release 6
======================

--------------------------
** Incompatible changes **
--------------------------

There are two major changes in this release, which *will* effect you if you
are upgrading from an older version:

 o The scripts have all moved (in the archive), and their names have been
   changed.  If you run "setup.py install", it will offer to remove the old
   ones for you, which we recommend.  In the archive, the scripts are all
   in a 'scripts' directory, and all the scripts start with the "sb_"
   prefix, to avoid clashing with similarly named scripts from other
   packages.  Some name changes go further - "pop3proxy" is now named
   "sb_server", "hammiefilter" is now named "sb_filter", "hammiecli" is now
   named "sb_client", "hammiesrv" is now named "sb_xmlrpcserver", "proxytee"
   is now named "sb_upload", and the experimental "overkill" script is now
   named "sb_pop3dnd".

If you were previously using the "hammie.py" script, you will notice that
it is no longer available.  We recommend that you use either "sb_filter"
(probably with "sb_mboxtrain"), or use "sb_server" and "sb_upload".  If you
wish to continue as you were, you can use the "hammie.py" module, which
will be installed in the "spambayes" package directory, in the same way you
used the old "hammie.py" script.

 o All the backwards compatibility code for options which changed names has
   been removed, which means that you *must* use the correct (new) names.
   A script (sb_chkopts) is provided which, if you run it, will inform you
   if you have any invalid names (if will not output anything if there are
   no problems).

In addition, the values taken by some options have changed, so if you're
upgrading from a previous version, you may need to update your configuration
file (.spambayesrc or bayescustomize.ini)

 o The options to put the classification in the subject or recipient list
   (notate_to and notate_subject) have moved from the "pop3proxy" section
   to the "Headers" section.
 o All the "pop3proxy" storage options (where the cache is stored, the
   number of days before messages expire, and so on) have moved to the
   "Storage" section.
 o The "hammie" debug header options have been removed, and you should use
   the "Headers" evidence header options instead.

Note that pop3proxy (sb_server) and imapfilter users can simply use the web
interface to check their options and correct any that are wrong.  All
incorrectly named options in the configuration file will be removed.

Outlook Plugin
--------------
 o Change the default for the ham/spam imbalance adjustment option to
   False - this should make misclassifications for those with large
   imbalances easier to understand.  Note that we recommend roughly equal
   numbers of ham and spam are trained.
 o Add a warning for those with highly imbalanced ham and spam.
 o Improved the 'Show Clues' results page.
 o When we fail to add the 'Spam' field to a read-only store (eg, hotmail),
   complain less loudly.

POP3 Proxy / SMTP Proxy
-----------------------
 o If running Windows, and have the win32 extensions installed, and a
   configuration file cannot be found, then default to placing it in the
   "Application Data" directory (as defined by Windows).  Also default to
   storing the caches and databases in this directory.
 o Correctly save and close the database when changing options.  This
   fixes a bug for those using gdbm databases.

Web Interface
-------------
 o Place a threshold on the number of items displayed per section in the
   review page.
 o Correctly display the proxy data when it is specified on the command
   line.

POP3 Proxy Service / POP3 Proxy Tray Application
------------------------------------------------

 o The POP3 proxy tray application (for Windows users), which quietly
   appeared in the 1.0a5 release, should be ready for use.  If you have
   the service installed, it will attempt to use that; if you do not,
   it will start up sb_server for you.
   ** Note that the tray application currently only works with Windows
   NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP, not Windows 95, 98, or ME.  This
   will be remedied in a future version, and in the binary release of
   the tray application. **
 o As the service starts, it reports the username and configuration file
   that it is using.
 o Added a version check option to the tray application.
 o Improved logged for both the service and the tray application.

IMAP Filter
-----------
 o Correctly handle IMAP servers that (wrongly) fail to put folder names
   in quotation marks
 o Count all messages being classified instead of just the ones from the
   last folder.
 o Handle a folder name as a literal when presenting a list to choose from.
 o Handle IMAP servers that do not pass a blank result line for an empty
   search.
 o Fix IMAP over SSL.

General
-------
 o Add a new file: NEWTRICKS.TXT to record ideas that have and haven't
   been tried.  If you would like to add to this, please submit a patch
   via the Sourceforge system.
 o Change the default to tokenizer the "To", "CC", "Reply-To", "Sender",
   and "From" address headers, rather than just "From".
 o Fix the database opening code so that hammie* again works with both
   dbm and pickles.
 o Minor performance boosts to hammiebulk and mboxtrain.

Developer
---------
 o Add a close method to the various storage classes.
 o Removed the gary_combining option and code.
