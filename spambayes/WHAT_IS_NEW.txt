This file covers the major changes between each release.  For more details,
the reader is referred to the changelog (CHANGELOG.TXT in the main directory
of the archive), or for extreme details, to the check-ins archive (see
<http://mail.python.org/pipermail/spambayes-checkins>)
                                                                   
Changes are broken into sections, so that it's easier for you to find the
changes that are relevant to you.

Any actions necessary to move to this release from the previous release are
noted in the "Transition" section.  You should also read the "Incompatible
changes" section.

New in Alpha (Beta?) Release 10 (1?)
====================================

--------------------------
** Incompatible changes **
--------------------------

 o The 'flat' or interchange format used by the sb_dbexpimp.py script has
   changed to CSV (comma-separated-values, as popularised by Microsoft
   Excel), rather than the old '`' separated format.  If you have any
   existing files in the old format, you should use the old 1.0a9 script to
   convert these back to a pickle (or some other format), and then use the
   new script to convert them to CSV (if desired).  This change should
   alleviate problems with some unicode characters in the database, and
   make it easier for other programs (such as Excel) to use the exported
   database.

There should be no other incompatible changes (from 1.0a9) in this release.


-------------------
** Other changes **
-------------------

Outlook Plugin
--------------
 o Various minor improvements.

POP3 Proxy / SMTP Proxy
-----------------------
 o Fix an error that stopped the SMTP proxy working at all in many cases.

Web Interface
-------------
 o The pre-filled out bug reports have been simplified somewhat, and
   the readability of the resulting message has been improved.
 o If a single choice was made for the "Notate To" or "Notate Subject"
   options, the configuration page would in future present that option
   with radio buttons instead of checkboxes, meaning that the option
   could not be turned off, and that adding an extra choice could not be
   made.  This has been fixed.

POP3 Proxy Service / POP3 Proxy Tray Application
------------------------------------------------
 o The POP3 Proxy service was left out of the 1.0a9 installer, although
   it was present in the source archive.  This has been corrected.

IMAP Filter
-----------
 o The filter better handles invalid messages.
 o The filter should leave the "Seen" status of messages alone with
   more IMAP servers than previously.

sb_filter
---------
 o Improved speed when using sb_filter.py to process an entire mailbox.

Tokenizer
---------
 o Collect all potential MTA complaints, not just sendmail's
   "may be forged".

General
-------
 o Added new flags and results data to the contrib/tte.py script.


Transition
==========
If you are transitioning from a version older than 1.0a9, please also
read the notes in the previous release notes (accessible from
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=61702>).

 o To take advantage of improvements in the tokenizing engine at the core
   of SpamBayes, you may wish to do a full retrain; this is not necessary,
   however.

See also the changes listed in "Incompatible changes" at the top of
this document.

Newly Deprecated Options
========================

Since 1.0a9, SpamBayes has had a method of noting options that are
deprecated and which will not be available in future releases (it is
likely that options will only be deprecated for one release before being
removed).  Deprecated options will not be offered in the graphical
interfaces (Outlook plugin and web interface), and will be listed in
the "What's New" file (this file) for each release.

Deprecated options have the same name as previously, but now begin with
"x-" (so "extract_dow" is now "x-extract_dow").  You can continue to use
the original name (e.g. "extract_dow") in your configuration file, but will
receive warnings in your log file or console window.  We recommend that you
examine this output every time you upgrade SpamBayes to ensure that you are
not using any newly deprecated options.

Discussion of why any particular option has been deprecated can be found in
the spambayes-dev archives (at <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/spambayes-dev>).

No options have been deprecated in this release.

The following options are still deprecated and will be removed in the near
future, unless testing indicates otherwise:
  o [Tokenizer] generate_time_buckets
  o [Tokenizer] extract_dow
  o [Classifier] experimental_ham_spam_imbalance_adjustment


New Experimental Options
========================

Since 1.0a9, SpamBayes has had a method of noting options that are
experimental and which may be removed or made permanent in future releases
(many experimental options will only be experimental for one release before
being removed or fully integrated).  Experimental options are not exposed
by the Outlook plugin, and are listed on a separate
"Experimental Configuration" page in the web interface.  The options will
be listed in the "What's New" file (this file) for each release.

Experimental options begin with "x-" (as do deprecated options).  If you
start using an experimental option and it later becomes permanent you can
continue to use the "x-" name in your configuration file, but will
receive warnings in your log file or console window.  We recommend that you
examine this output every time you upgrade SpamBayes to ensure that you are
using the correct name for all options.

Discussion of why experimental options and results from using them can be
found in the spambayes-dev archives (at
<http://mail.python.org/pipermail/spambayes-dev>).  Ideally, we would like
users to test these options out on their mail and let us know the results.
This can be as simple as turning on the option and emailing
spambayes@python.org with anecdotal results after a period of time, or the
full testtools scripts can be used.  For details about using these, please
read the "README-DEVEL.txt" file that comes with the SpamBayes source
archive.

Experimental options are always turned off by default.

No experimental options have been added in this release.

Experimental options that are currently available (which we invite you to
try out and report back your results) include:
  o [Tokenizer] x-search_for_habeas_headers
  o [Tokenizer] x-reduce_habeas_headers
    These generate tokens based on the Habeas headers (see
    <http://habeas.com> for more details).
  
  o [Classifier] x-use_bigrams
    By default, SpamBayes uses unigrams tokens that are basically
    single words (split on whitespace).  This option enables both unigrams
    and bigrams (pairs of words), but uses a 'tiling' scheme, where only
    the set of unigrams and bigrams that have the strongest effect on
    the message are used.

  o [URLRetriever] x-slurp_urls
  o [URLRetriever] x-cache_expiry_days
  o [URLRetriever] x-cache_directory
  o [URLRetriever] x-only_slurp_base
  o [URLRetriever] x-web_prefix
    If these are used, if a message is scored as 'unsure', and could use
    more tokens in its classification, then text from any URLs in the
    message is retrieved and used, if it makes a difference to the
    classification.

  o [Tokenizer] x-pick_apart_urls
    Pick out some semantic bits from URLs.

  o [Tokenizer] x-fancy_url_recognition
    Recognize 'abbreviated' URLs of the form www.xyz.com or ftp.xyz.com as
    http://www.xyz.com and ftp://ftp.xyz.com, respectively.  This gets rid
    of some fairly common "skip:w NNN" tokens.
