This file covers the major changes between each release.  For more details,
the reader is referred to the changelog (CHANGELOG.TXT in the main directory
of the source archive), or for extreme details, to the check-ins archive
(see <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/spambayes-checkins>).
                                                                   
Changes are broken into sections, so that it's easier for you to find the
changes that are relevant to you.

Any actions necessary to move to this release from the previous release are
noted in the "Incompatible changes and Transitioning" section.

Note that this is an alpha release, intended for those willing to try out
very cutting edge software.  It is likely that there are a few unresolved
bugs with this release.  If you would rather wait for a more stable release
to have the new features here, please continue to use 1.0.4 until 1.1 final
is released.

New in 1.1 Alpha 1
==================


--------------------------------------------
** Incompatible changes and Transitioning **
--------------------------------------------

There should be no incompatible changes (from 1.0.2) in this release.
If you are transitioning from a version older than 1.0.2, please
read the notes in the previous release notes (accessible from
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=61702>).


-------------------
** Other changes **
-------------------

General
-------
 o Localisations (translations of the user interface) of SpamBayes are
   now available.  1.1 includes French and Spanish translations - many
   thanks to the translators for their efforts.  If you would like to
   add a translation in a new language (or dialect), please contact the
   SpamBayes development team at spambayes-dev@python.org.  For Windows
   users, SpamBayes will use the same language as the operating system
   is set to use (if available).  This can be overridden (or set, for
   non-Windows users) via the configuration file.
 o The version number scheme has been improved and simplified.
 o Many more unittests have been added.  For the end user, this should
   mean that changes in later versions are much less likely to break
   existing functionality.
 o New storage types are available: CDBClassifier (uses a CDB database,
   similar to that used by CdbClassifier, but not identical),
   ZODBClassifier (uses a ZODB FileStorage object) and ZEOClassifier
   (connects to a ZEO server).
 o The "use bigrams" option is no longer experimental, although is still
   off by default.

Outlook Plugin
--------------
 o The Manager dialog is enlarged (at least 800x600 resolution is needed
   to view it - 640x480 users will need to continue with 1.0.2) and
   enhanced to (among other things) include a new "Statistics" tab.
 o The "Show Clues" message is enchanced.  This now includes information
   about the last time the message was trained or classified.
 o For messages received from a local Exchange server, which have no
   Internet headers, we now generate more (and better) headers from the
   available message properties.
 o Statistics are vastly improved.  More statistics are reported, and
   these are persistent across Outlook sessions.  The statistics may
   be 'reset' so that they are calculated from a specified date and time.
 o Enable movement/copying of ham (good) messages, like the existing
   functionality for unsure/spam messages.
 o The "Delete As Spam" button is now simply "Spam", and the
   "Recover From Spam" button simply "Not Spam".  The behaviour of
   the buttons has not changed.  You may need to recreate the toolbar
   to see these changes (right click on the toolbar, click Customize,
   select SpamBayes, click Delete, then restart Outlook).
 o Notification sounds can now be set, via the Manager dialog.
 o The SpamBayes menu now includes an "Empty Spam Folder" option.
 o Outlook users can now use a variety of different underlying database
   storage methods, in the same fashion as non-Outlook users.

POP3 Proxy (sb_server.py)
-------------------------
 o POP over SSL is partially available.  The connection from the mail
   client to sb_server still cannot be over SSL, but the connection
   from sb_server to the mail server can be.  The latter is more likely
   to be at risk (as it is more likely to be non-local), so is the
   more important, as well as the easier to implement.
 o "Subject" (and "To") notations are removed from messages before display
   in the review pages and before training such messages.
 o The "To" header notations are in a new form, which is correctly an
   email address.
 o A particular type of malformed message (one with no header-body
   separator) would pass through SpamBayes without classification, or
   a X-Spambayes-Exception header.  This is no longer the case.
 o If you run sb_server as a Windows service messages are now logged
   to the Windows Event log rather than to SpamBayes log files.
 o Installation of the Windows service for sb_server has been improved,
   and a better data directory is now used (if a configuration file
   does not already exist, then a "SpamBayesData" directory in the
   directory of the application is used).

Web interface (sb_server.py and sb_imapfilter.py)
-------------------------------------------------
 o Improve the "More Statistics" page.  More statistics are reported, and
   the statistics may be 'reset' so that they are calculated from a
   specified date and time.
 o A new option "Use bigrams" is available from the Advanced Configuration
   page.
 o Messages that are uploaded (from the "Upload" box on the main page,
   or via sb_upload.py) are now properly added to the cache directories,
   and _pop3proxyham.mbox and pop3proxy_spam.mbox are no longer created.
 o Various minor fixes and improvements.

IMAP Filter (sb_imapfilter.py)
------------------------------
 o Use the "Message-ID" header as the SpamBayes ID (when possible).  This
   means that the IMAP filter should not need to rewrite nearly as many
   messages (hopefully, should need to rewrite no ham messages), and should
   also work faster and more reliably.
 o A ham folder may now be specified, like the spam and unsure folders.
 o Continue on (skipping) if a folder is unable to be acccesed for training
   or filtering.
 o Filtering multiple servers with a single sb_imapfilter process is now
   supported.  Enter in the server names, separated by commas, and the
   usernames and passwords separated by '\'s.  The filter will also try
   and load a configuration file for each server (it will look in the
   same directory as the main configuration file, for a file called
   server.name.ini or .spambayes_server_name_rc), where you can change
   the folders to filter, the thresholds, or any other options (this
   currently does not include the database names).
 o AUTH CRAM-MD5 authentication is now supported, in addition to plaintext
   AUTH Login.
 o Many minor fixes and improvements.

sb_pop3dnd.py
-------------
Many improvements.  Should now be useable.  Binary now included.  Tray
app now included.
 o Spam classification and spam training have been separated out into
   separate folders.
 o No longer uses the web interface.  Configuration is available via
   a dialog, training is via drag and drop between IMAP folders, and
   information is provided in the "Inbox" IMAP folder.

New
---
 o Andrew Dalke's sb_culler.py script (an updated version) is now
   included in the source distribution.
 o The new hammie2cdb.py script converts standard spambayes.Storage
   databases into cdb databases usable by CdbClassifier.
 o The new postfixproxy.py script is a proxy filter for use with
   PostFix 2.1's content filter functionality.
 o The new pycksum.py script is a fuzzy checksum program.
 o The new showclues.py script outputs to stdout a 'show clues' report like
   the one that Outlook creates, with the clues, tokens and message stream.

Other
-----
 o The sb_upload.py script's help string has been improved, and the
   -n (--null) command line option now works.  The script is now also
   able to train as well as upload.
 o The tte.py script has had many improvements, including Python 2.3
   compatibility, addition of a --ratio flag, deletion of correctly
   scoring messages, an improved scoring algorithm, and improved
   detection of whether a message is a miss or not.
 o A version of sb_bnfilter that is implemented in C (for speed) is
   now available.

Deprecated Options
==================

No options are currently deprecated.


Experimental Options
====================

We would like to remind users about our set of experimental options.  These
are options which we believe may be of benefit to users, but have not been
tested throughly enough to warrent full inclusion.  We would greatly
appreciate feedback from users willing to try these options out as to their
perceived benefit.  Both source code and binary users (including Outlook)
can try these options out.

More information about the experimental options and how to enable them
can be found at:
  http://spambayes.org/experimental.html

If you have any queries about the experimental options, please email
spambayes@python.org and we will try and answer them.
                                                          
Experimental options that are currently available include:
  o [Tokenizer] x-search_for_habeas_headers
  o [Tokenizer] x-reduce_habeas_headers
    These generate tokens based on the Habeas headers (see
    <http://habeas.com> for more details).
  
  o [URLRetriever] x-slurp_urls
  o [URLRetriever] x-cache_expiry_days
  o [URLRetriever] x-cache_directory
  o [URLRetriever] x-only_slurp_base
  o [URLRetriever] x-web_prefix
    If these are used, if a message is scored as 'unsure', and could use
    more tokens in its classification, then text from any URLs in the
    message is retrieved and used, if it makes a difference to the
    classification.

  o [Tokenizer] x-pick_apart_urls
    Pick out some semantic bits from URLs.

  o [Tokenizer] x-fancy_url_recognition
    Recognize 'abbreviated' URLs of the form www.xyz.com or ftp.xyz.com as
    http://www.xyz.com and ftp://ftp.xyz.com, respectively.  This gets rid
    of some fairly common "skip:w NNN" tokens.
