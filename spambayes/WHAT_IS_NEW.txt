This file covers the major changes between each release.  For more details,
the reader is referred to the changelog, or for extreme details, to the
check-ins archive.

Changes are broken into sections for each application, plus one that will
probably only interest developers, and one for everything else.

Any actions necessary to move to this release from the previous release are
noted in the "Transition" section.

New in Alpha Release 4
======================

Outlook Plugin
--------------
 o Display a message for "Delete as Spam" or "Recover from Spam" when
   SpamBayes is not enabled.
 o The toolbar is now initialized when "Outlook Today" is the default view.

POP3 Proxy
----------
 o Fix a bug where long attachments would be broken.
 o If an exception occurs parsing a message, recover and append a new
   'exception' header.
   (This will be added to other SpamBayes applications by the next
    release).
 o Stop including the trailing dot in messages.

IMAP Filter
-----------
 o In imapfilter, try to append without flags if appending fails.
 o Fix the -i switch in imapfilter and an import error.
 o Don't try and get password from options if -p is specified in imapfilter.

Developer
---------
 o Various changes/improvements to storage.py.
   Note that this includes a fix for a potentially serious bug introduced
   in a3 which could result in incorrect token counts.

General
-------
 o The web interface (used by pop3proxy and imapfilter) now shows the
   correct date and time in the footer.
 o A new stripper to squash yet another way of hiding content in HTML spam,
   like Ere<frame><noframes>ywl55</noframes></frame>ctions to hide
   Erections.
