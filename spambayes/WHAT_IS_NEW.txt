This file covers the major changes between each release.  For more details,
the reader is referred to the changelog (changelog.txt in the main directory
of the archive), or for extreme details, to the check-ins archive (please see

Changes are broken into sections for each application, plus one that will
probably only interest developers, and one for everything else.
