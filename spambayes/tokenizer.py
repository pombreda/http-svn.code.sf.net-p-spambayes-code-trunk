# To fold case or not to fold case?  I didn't want to fold case, because
# it hides information in English, and I have no idea what .lower() does
# to other languages; and, indeed, 'FREE' (all caps) turned out to be one
# of the strongest spam indicators in my content-only tests (== one with
# prob 0.99 *and* made it into spamprob's nbest list very often).
#
# Against preservering case, it makes the database size larger, and requires
# more training data to get enough "representative" mixed-case examples.
#
# Running my c.l.py tests didn't support my intuition that case was
# valuable, so it's getting folded away now.  Folding or not made no
# significant difference to the false positive rate, and folding made a
# small (but statistically significant all the same) reduction in the
# false negative rate.  There is one obvious difference:  after folding
# case, conference announcements no longer got high spam scores.  Their
# content was usually fine, but they were highly penalized for VISIT OUR
# WEBSITE FOR MORE INFORMATION! kinds of repeated SCREAMING.  That is
# indeed the language of advertising, and I halfway regret that folding
# away case no longer picks on them.
#
# Since the f-p rate didn't change, but conference announcements escaped
# that category, something else took their place.  It seems to be highly
# off-topic messages, like debates about Microsoft's place in the world.
# Talk about "money" and "lucrative" is indistinguishable now from talk
# about "MONEY" and "LUCRATIVE", and spam mentions MONEY a lot.

# Character n-grams or words?
#
# With careful multiple-corpora c.l.py tests sticking to case-folded decoded
# text-only portions, and ignoring headers, and with identical special
# parsing & tagging of embedded URLs:
#
# Character 3-grams gave 5x as many false positives as split-on-whitespace
# (s-o-w).  The f-n rate was also significantly worse, but within a factor
# of 2.  So character 3-grams lost across the board.
#
# Character 5-grams gave 32% more f-ps than split-on-whitespace, but the
# s-o-w fp rate across 20,000 presumed-hams was 0.1%, and this is the
# difference between 23 and 34 f-ps.  There aren't enough there to say that's
# significnatly more with killer-high confidence.  There were plenty of f-ns,
# though, and the f-n rate with character 5-grams was substantially *worse*
# than with character 3-grams (which in turn was substantially worse than
# with s-o-w).
#
# Training on character 5-grams creates many more unique tokens than s-o-w:
# a typical run bloated to 150MB process size.  It also ran a lot slower than
# s-o-w, partly related to heavy indexing of a huge out-of-cache wordinfo
# dict.  I rarely noticed disk activity when running s-o-w, so rarely bothered
# to look at process size; it was under 30MB last time I looked.
#
# Figuring out *why* a msg scored as it did proved much more mysterious when
# working with character n-grams:  they often had no obvious "meaning".  In
# contrast, it was always easy to figure out what s-o-w was picking up on.
# 5-grams flagged a msg from Christian Tismer as spam, where he was discussing
# the speed of tasklets under his new implementation of stackless:
#
#     prob = 0.99999998959
#     prob('ed sw') = 0.01
#     prob('http0:pgp') = 0.01
#     prob('http0:python') = 0.01
#     prob('hlon ') = 0.99
#     prob('http0:wwwkeys') = 0.01
#     prob('http0:starship') = 0.01
#     prob('http0:stackless') = 0.01
#     prob('n xp ') = 0.99
#     prob('on xp') = 0.99
#     prob('p 150') = 0.99
#     prob('lon x') = 0.99
#     prob(' amd ') = 0.99
#     prob(' xp 1') = 0.99
#     prob(' athl') = 0.99
#     prob('1500+') = 0.99
#     prob('xp 15') = 0.99
#
# The spam decision was baffling until I realized that *all* the high-
# probablity spam 5-grams there came out of a single phrase:
#
#     AMD Athlon XP 1500+
#
# So Christian was punished for using a machine lots of spam tries to sell
# <wink>.  In a classic Bayesian classifier, this probably wouldn't have
# mattered, but Graham's throws away almost all the 5-grams from a msg,
# saving only the about-a-dozen farthest from a neutral 0.5.  So one bad
# phrase can kill you!  This appears to happen very rarely, but happened
# more than once.
#
# The conclusion is that character n-grams have almost nothing to recommend
# them under Graham's scheme:  harder to work with, slower, much larger
# database, worse results, and prone to rare mysterious disasters.
#
# There's one area they won hands-down:  detecting spam in what I assume are
# Asian languages.  The s-o-w scheme sometimes finds only line-ends to split
# on then, and then a "hey, this 'word' is way too big!  let's ignore it"
# gimmick kicks in, and produces no tokens at all.
#
# [Later:  we produce character 5-grams then under the s-o-w scheme, instead
# ignoring the blob, but only if there are high-bit characters in the blob;
# e.g., there's no point 5-gramming uuencoded lines, and doing so would
# bloat the database size.]
#
# Interesting:  despite that odd example above, the *kinds* of f-p mistakes
# 5-grams made were very much like s-o-w made -- I recognized almost all of
# the 5-gram f-p messages from previous s-o-w runs.  For example, both
# schemes have a particular hatred for conference announcements, although
# s-o-w stopped hating them after folding case.  But 5-grams still hate them.
# Both schemes also hate msgs discussing HTML with examples, with about equal
# passion.   Both schemes hate brief "please subscribe [unsubscribe] me"
# msgs, although 5-grams seems to hate them more.

# How to tokenize?
#
# I started with string.split() merely for speed.  Over time I realized it
# was making interesting context distinctions qualitatively akin to n-gram
# schemes; e.g., "free!!" is a much stronger spam indicator than "free".  But
# unlike n-grams (whether word- or character- based) under Graham's scoring
# scheme, this mild context dependence never seems to go over the edge in
# giving "too much" credence to an unlucky phrase.
#
# OTOH, compared to "searching for words", it increases the size of the
# database substantially, less than but close to a factor of 2.  This is very
# much less than a word bigram scheme bloats it, but as always an increase
# isn't justified unless the results are better.
#
# Following are stats comparing
#
#    for token in text.split():  # left column
#
# to
#
#    for token in re.findall(r"[\w$\-\x80-\xff]+", text):  # right column
#
# text is case-normalized (text.lower()) in both cases, and the runs were
# identical in all other respects.  The results clearly favor the split()
# gimmick, although they vaguely suggest that some sort of compromise
# may do as well with less database burden; e.g., *perhaps* folding runs of
# "punctuation" characters into a canonical representative could do that.
# But the database size is reasonable without that, and plain split() avoids
# having to worry about how to "fold punctuation" in languages other than
# English.

# What about HTML?
#
# Computer geeks seem to view use of HTML in mailing lists and newsgroups as
# a mortal sin.  Normal people don't, but so it goes:  in a technical list/
# group, every HTML decoration has spamprob 0.99, there are lots of unique
# HTML decorations, and lots of them appear at the very start of the message
# so that Graham's scoring scheme latches on to them tight.  As a result,
# any plain text message just containing an HTML example is likely to be
# judged spam (every HTML decoration is an extreme).
#
# So if a message is multipart/alternative with both text/plain and text/html
# branches, we ignore the latter, else newbies would never get a message
# through.  If a message is just HTML, it has virtually no chance of getting
# through.
#
# In an effort to let normal people use mailing lists too <wink>, and to
# alleviate the woes of messages merely *discussing* HTML practice, I
# added a gimmick to strip HTML tags after case-normalization and after
# special tagging of embedded URLs.  This consisted of a regexp sub pattern,
# where instances got replaced by single blanks:
#
#    html_re = re.compile(r"""
#        <
#        [^\s<>]     # e.g., don't match 'a < b' or '<<<' or 'i << 5' or 'a<>b'
#        [^>]{0,128} # search for the end '>', but don't chew up the world
#        >
#    """, re.VERBOSE)

# The messages merely discussing HTML were no longer fps, so it did what it
# intended there.  But the f-n rate nearly doubled on at least one run -- so
# strong a set of spam indicators is the mere presence of HTML.  The increase
# in the number of fps despite that the HTML-discussing msgs left that
# category remains mysterious to me, but it wasn't a significant increase
# so I let it drop.
#
# Later:  If I simply give up on making mailing lists friendly to my sisters
# (they're not nerds, and create wonderfully attractive HTML msgs), a
# compromise is to strip HTML tags from only text/plain msgs.  That's
# principled enough so far as it goes, and eliminates the HTML-discussing
# false positives.  It remains disturbing that the f-n rate on pure HTML
# msgs increases significantly when stripping tags, so the code here doesn't
# do that part.  However, even after stripping tags, the rates above show that
# at least 98% of spams are still correctly identified as spam.
#
# So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here not
# to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.

# How big should "a word" be?
#
# As I write this, words less than 3 chars are ignored completely, and words
# with more than 12 are special-cased, replaced with a summary "I skipped
# about so-and-so many chars starting with such-and-such a letter" token.
# This makes sense for English if most of the info is in "regular size"
# words.
#
# A test run boosting to 13 had no effect on f-p rate, and did a little
# better or worse than 12 across runs -- overall, no significant difference.
# The database size is smaller at 12, so there's nothing in favor of 13.
# A test at 11 showed a slight but consistent bad effect on the f-n rate
# (lost 12 times, won once, tied 7 times).
#
# A test with no lower bound showed a significant increase in the f-n rate.
# Curious, but not worth digging into.  Boosting the lower bound to 4 is a
# worse idea:  f-p and f-n rates both suffered significantly then.  I didn't
# try testing with lower bound 2.
