<h3>For MacOS 9</h3>
<h4>before anything</h4>
<p>Due to MacOS multitasking, the popproxy does not work very fast. On a
Cube 
or a  G4 400, I found it usable but not much. YMMV.
To handle network connection to <em>localhost</em> it is easier to add a
host file. If you don't have one already, create one with any text editor.</p>
<p>Its name must be "hosts". It should be located in the "Preference" folder.
Its content should be similar to:
<pre>
localhost CNAME yourmac.example.com
yourmac.example.com A 127.0.0.1
</pre></p>
<p>The localhost and 127.0.0.1 values must be exactly like this. If you
don't 
know the right value to use for yourmac.example.com, put
anything that looks like this. The end of the first line must be the same as
the beginning of the second line.</p>
<p>When this file is created, go to the "TCP/IP" control panel. Set the user level
to Administrator. Click on "Use a host file" and select this file. Save
your changes.</p>
<p>On the Mac, you can transform a Python script into a double-clickable
applet. Just drag & drop the pop3proxy.py script onto the BuildApplet
application. You'll get a double-clickable pop3proxy application.</p>
<p>Start pop3proxy and open up a web browser to http://localhost:8880.
Click on the Configuration link.</p>
<p>Ensure that the servers line looks like:
<pre>
pop3proxy_servers: pop.videotron.ca:110,mail.ulaval.ca:110
</pre>
And that the ports line looks like:
<pre>
pop3proxy_ports: 110, 6111
</pre>
<h4>Configuring Entourage</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Tools menu and choose Accounts.</li>
<li>Click on New and choose POP.</li>
<li>Fill in the various fields. For the POP server field, put "localhost".</li>
<li>For the videotron account, you are done.</li>
<li>For the ulaval account,  in the "Advance receive option" windows click on
the "Ignore the default POP port" check box and type in 6111.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Filtering with Entourage</h4>
<p>The rule can be:
<pre>
If
    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains ham
then    
    do nothing
If
    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains spam
then    
    Move message to folder Spam
If
    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains unsure
then    
    Move message to folder Unsure
</pre>

<h4>Configuring Eudora</h4>
<p>In Eudora, you will be able to reach only one pop server, since you can
configure only one port number for POP. But on this server, you can access
more than one account.</p>
<p>Go to the Tool menu and choose Personalities.</p>
<p>Create an new personality with the POP server as "localhost".</p>
<p>With the proposed "bayescustomize.ini" you will be able to talk only to
the videotron server.</p>
<h4>Filtering with Eudora</h4>
<p>The rule can be:
<pre>

    do nothing
Match
    Header: X-Spambayes-Classification contains spam
Action    
    Transfer To Spam
Match
