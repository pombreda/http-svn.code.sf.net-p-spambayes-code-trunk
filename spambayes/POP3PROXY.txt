Additional Information about using the POP3 Proxy.
==================================================

For MacOS 9
-----------
As a result of the MacOS multitasking, the proxy may not work very fast
(reports suggest that at least a Cube or G4 400 is necessary; YMMV).

To handle a network connection to 'localhost', it is easiest to add a host
file.  If you don't have one already, create a text file called "hosts" in
the "Preferences" folder.  The content of the file should be:
	localhost CNAME yourmac.example.com
	yourmac.example.com	A 127.0.0.1
The localhost and 127.0.0.1 values must be exactly like this.  If you don't
know the right value to use for "yourmac.example.com", put anything that
looks like this.  The end of the first line must be the same as the start of
the second line.
When this file is created, go to the "TCP/IP" control panl.  Set the user
level to 'Administrator'.  Click on "Use a host file" and select this file.
Save your changes.

On the Mac, you can transform a Python script into a double-clickable
applet. Just drag & drop the pop3proxy.py script onto the BuildApplet
application. You'll get a double-clickable pop3proxy application.

To setup:
  1. Start pop3proxy and open up a web browser to http://localhost:8880.
  2. Click on the Configuration link.
  3. Ensure that the servers line looks like:
	pop3proxy_servers: pop.example.com:110,mail.example.com:110
  4. And that the ports line looks like:
	pop3proxy_ports: 110, 111

To configure Entourage:
  1. Go to the 'Tools' menu and choose 'Accounts'.
  2. Click on 'New' and choose 'POP'.
  3. Fill in the various fields. For the POP server field, put "localhost".
  4. For the pop.example.com account, you are done.
  5. For the mail.example.com account,  in the "Advance receive option"
     window click on the "Ignore the default POP port" check box and type
     in 111.

To filter with Entourage:
The rule can be:
	If
	    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains ham
	then    
	    do nothing
	If
	    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains spam
	then    
	    Move message to folder Spam
	If
	    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains unsure
	then    
	    Move message to folder Unsure

To configure Eudora:
In Eudora, you will be able to reach only one pop server, since you can
configure only one port number for POP. But on this server, you can access
more than one account.
  1. Go to the 'Tools' menu and choose 'Personalities'.
  2. Create a new personality with the POP server as "localhost".
  Note: You will be able to talk only to the pop.example.com server.

To filter with Eudora:
The rule can be:
	Match
	    Header: X-Spambayes-Classification contains ham
	Action    
	    do nothing
	Match
	    Header: X-Spambayes-Classification contains spam
	Action    
	    Transfer To Spam
	Match
	    Header: X-Spambayes-Classification contains unsure
	Action    
	    Transfer To Unsure
