<h3>For MacOS 9</h3>
<h4>before anything</h4>
<p>Due to MacOS multitasking, the popproxy does not work very fast. On a
Cube 
or a  G4 400, I found it usable but not much. YMMV.
To handle network connection to <em>localhost</em> it is easier to add a
host file. If you don't have one already, create one with any text editor.
<p>It name must be "hosts". It should be located in the "Preference" foder.
It content should be similar to:
<pre>
localhost CNAME fbgmac.intranet.teleprosoft.com
fbgmac.intranet.teleprosoft.com A 127.0.0.1
</pre>
<p>The localhost and 127.0.0.1 values must be exactly like this. If you
don't 
know the right value to use for fbgmac.intranet.teleprosoft.com put
anything looking like this one. It have to be exactly the same for end of
first line and biggining of second line.
<p>When this file is created, go to "TCP/IP" control panel. Set user level
to Administrator. Click on "Use a host file" and select this file. Save
your changes.
<p>On the Mac, you can transform a Python script into a double clickable
applet. Just Drag & Drop the pop3proxy.py script onto the BuildApplet
application. You'll get a double clickable pop3proxy application.
<p>Create or modify the "bayescustomize.ini" file in the Spambayes folder.
<p> be sur you have these lines:
<pre>
[pop3proxy]
pop3proxy_servers: pop.videotron.ca:110,mail.ulaval.ca:110
pop3proxy_ports: 110, 6111
</pre>
<h4>Configuring Entourage</h4>
<p>Go to the Tools menu and choose Accounts.
<p>Click on New and choose POP.
<p>Fill in the various fields. For the POP server field, put "localhost".
<p>For the videotron account, you are done.
<p>For the ulaval account,  in the "Advance receive option" windows click on
the "Ignore the default POP port" check box and type in 6111.
<h4>Filtering with Entourage</h4>
<p>The rule can be:
<pre>
If
    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains ham
then    
    do nothing
If
    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains spam
then    
    Move message to folder Spam
If
    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains unsure
then    
    Move message to folder Unsure
</pre>


<h4>Configuring Eudora</h4>
<p>In Eudora, you will be able to reach only one pop server, since you can
configure only one port number for POP. But on this server, you can access
more than one account.
<p>Go to the Tool menu and choose Personalities.
<p>Create an new personality with the POP server as "localhost".
<p>With the proposed "bayescustomize.ini" you will be able to talk onlu to
the videotron server.
