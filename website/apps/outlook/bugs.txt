Frequently Reported Bugs
========================

Installation fails with "DLL Registration" error
------------------------------------------------
A number of users report errors at install time registering the DLL.  Most 
of these helpfully say "Error 0".  Some users have reported that changing 
the install path to a 'simpler' version solves it for them (but this seems 
strange to the developers!).  We are tracking this in `Bug 807618`_.

Outlook Toolbars Fail
---------------------
This is a common problem, and 99% of users find that the 
`Troubleshooting Guide`_ solves this issue for them.  However,
at least one user has reported this does not work for him.
We are tracking this issue in bug `[ 828669 ] Toolbars refuse to work after reset`_.

Various issues with Outlook builtin rules
-----------------------------------------
There are a number of reports regarding SpamBayes 'missing' messages that
have also been processed by the builtin Outlook rules.  Outlook does not 
expose a way of avoiding this.  To work around the problem, SpamBayes has a 
'Background Processing' option you can set in the Advanced tab of the 
SpamBayes manager.  Any bugs on this issue will be closed as 'Wont Fix' 
('Can't Fix' would be better, but that doesn't exist <wink>)

New Mail Icon not cleared when Spam is marked as Read
-----------------------------------------------------
This is a known problem, but Outlook does not provide a reasonable technique
for preventing it.  Please see our `FAQ entry on this issue`_.

Customize Outlook Today stops working
-------------------------------------
This is likely to be a Microsoft Issue - see a 
`Microsoft Knowledge Base article`_ on the issue, or 
`our (closed) bug #810902`_.

.. _Microsoft Knowledge Base article: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q820575

PGP addin causes crashes
------------------------
The PGP freeware plugin for Outlook is known to cause a number of problems, 
both with and without SpamBayes installed.  SpamBayes seems to have no 
impact on how often PGP will cause Outlook to crash.  If you use the PGP
plugin, please disable it while you are not using it - your crashes are
almost certain to stop.
