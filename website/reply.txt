What is Spambayes?
------------------

The Spambayes project was formed to develop a Bayesian anti-spam filter, 
initially based on the work of Paul Graham.  The major difference between 
this and other, similar projects is the emphasis on testing newer 
approaches to scoring messages.  You can read all about Spambayes on the 
project's website:

    http://spambayes.sf.net/


Will Spambayes run on my system/in my environment?
--------------------------------------------------

Yes, though which tools you use and the amount of work necessary to get 
started will vary depending on your computing platform, email client and 
how you get mail from a mail server.


I'm having trouble installing Spambayes.  Help!
-----------------------------------------------

There were problems installing the Outlook plug-in on some combinations of
Windows and Outlook for early versions of the plug-in.  Version 003 seems to
install properly with all combinations of Windows and Outlook which have
been tried so far.  As of 2003-07-28, the most recent version is 006.  If
you are trying to install or run an earlier version, you should upgrade.

If you post your bug report to the mailing list, there's always the chance
it will get missed.  Filing a bug report also provides a single place to 
collect all the data related to the bug, making it easier to put all the 
pieces together which are necessary to fix the underlying problem.
