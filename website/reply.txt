What is Spambayes?
------------------

The Spambayes project was formed to develop a Bayesian anti-spam filter,
initially based on the work of Paul Graham.  The major difference between
this and other, similar projects is the emphasis on testing newer approaches
to scoring messages.  You can read all about Spambayes on the project's
website:

    http://spambayes.sf.net/

Will Spambayes run on my system/in my environment?
--------------------------------------------------

Yes, though which tools you use and the amount of work necessary to get
started will vary depending on your computing platform, email client and how
you get mail from a mail server.

I'm having trouble installing Spambayes.  Help!
-----------------------------------------------

There are known problems installing the Outlook plug-in on some combinations
of Windows and Outlook.  Consult

    http://spambayes.sf.net/windows.html

for information about these problems.

People who are not using the binary installer for the Outlook plugin should
consult

    http://spambayes.sf.net/download.html

to see what versions of Python will work with Spambayes.

For other installation issues, please file a bug report (see below).
