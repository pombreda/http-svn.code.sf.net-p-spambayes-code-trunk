What is Spambayes?
------------------

The SpamBayes project was formed to develop a Bayesian anti-spam filter,
initially based on the work of Paul Graham.  The major difference between
this and other, similar projects is the emphasis on testing newer approaches
to scoring messages.  You can read all about Spambayes on the project's
website:

    http://spambayes.sf.net/

Will Spambayes run on my system/in my environment?
--------------------------------------------------

Yes, though which tools you use and the amount of work necessary to get
started will vary depending on your computing platform, email client and how
you get mail from a mail server.

I'm having trouble installing Spambayes.  Help!
-----------------------------------------------

There is a known problem installing the Outlook plug-in on Windows XP.
(What are the symptoms?  Is there a workaround?)  Note that you also need a
recent enough version of Python installed on your system.  Consult

    http://spambayes.sf.net/download.html

for information about what versions of Python will work with Spambayes.

For other installation issues, please file a bug report (see below).
