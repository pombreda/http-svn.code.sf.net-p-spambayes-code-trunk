<h2>Projects based on SpamBayes (Commercial or otherwise)</h2>
<p>These are some projects that are based on SpamBayes.  Those that are commercial offer the same success in filtering mail, but in exchange for forking out some money, may be more user-friendly and offer more in the way of support.</p>
<ul>
<li>SpamAtBay is a soon to be available commercial version of the SpamBayes addin for Outlook.  SpamAtBay development is headed by Sean True, who wrote the first integration of Outlook and SpamBayes (later this was improved on - basically rewritten using the same idea - by Mark Hammond).
SpamAtBay has a more polished layout, documentation and some more consumer oriented features.  Contact <a href="mailto:seant@webreply.com ">Sean True</a> for more information.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.inboxer.com">InBoxer</a>.  This is a consumer-oriented release with a simple one-click install process, based on SpamAtBay (in turn, based on SpamBayes). Contact <a href="mailto:info@inboxer.com">Roger Matus</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Commercial Products using "Bayesian" style filtering</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.spambully.com/">Spam Bully</a> is a commercial spam filter that claims to use bayesian techniques.
<li><a href="http://Death2Spam.net/">Death2Spam</a> is a hosted service offering Bayesian-style filtering (written in Java). Richard Jowsey writes: 
"D2S is based on a combination of Paul Graham's and Gary Robinson's theory 
and techniques. It has many similarities to the tokenizer & classifier 
logic used in SpamBayes (I'm not a great Python devotee, but the code is 
quite legible), and POPFile. And, after much experimentation and testing, 
I've considerably elaborated some of the statistical and probability math 
in there."
